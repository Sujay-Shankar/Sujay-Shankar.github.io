    <h1>My Research</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My specialty is astronomical data analysis with Python. Projects I've worked on are listed below with approximately how long I worked on them, as well as a concise explanation.</p>
    <h3 style="display:inline; padding-right:20px">blase3D</h3><p style="display:inline">[1 year]</p>
    <p>Taking precomputed synthetic stellar spectral models, reading their line properties with ML, interpolating said line properties, and constructing a spectral inference algorithm with Gaussian Processes.</p>
    <h3 style="display:inline; padding-right:20px">reversion</h3><p style="display:inline">[1 year]</p>
    <p>Integrating millions of star orbits in the Milky Way potential back in time for 10 billion years, and finding intersections with globular cluster orbits, with chemical and photometric followup to identify stars that escaped from globular clusters in the past.</p>
    <h3 style="display:inline; padding-right:20px">gollum</h3><p style="display:inline">[2 years]</p>
    <p>Creating a Python library to access, transform, and visualize spectra from multiple precomputed synthetic spectral model grids including PHOENIX and Sonora.</p>
