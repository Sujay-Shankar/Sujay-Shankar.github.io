    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        My interests include building computers and gaming, you could say in general I'm a tech enthusiast. 
        I also enjoy hiking, martial arts, and playing volleyball in terms of physical activities. I've also been known to play tennis and pickleball on occasion.
        My philosophy is to keep life organized and minimal, while doing things as efficiently as possible.
        I try to be healthy and happy, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my lifestyle.
